# Simple Business Card Created with React

This project is my first React app bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

You will first need to install NPM modules by running npm install.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Alternatively, the app can be hosted on http://localhost:3000 via Node and Express. You first need to run 

### 'npm install express --save'

Then you can run the app via node server/server.js in the root file.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**
Tech used: Express, Node, React, Javascript.

The focus for this project was to make a simple business card app using React for the first time.

## Optimizations

This is my first React app and it's fairly simple, so I don't see a ton of need for further optimization. I didn't want to spend too much time on this,
but I could not figure out how to import icons into a React project, so I decided to use images instead for icons. I couldn't add styling to images, so if I had to optimize further, I could have spent more time figuring out how to import the icons so the styling could be improved.

## Lessons Learned:

This is my first time using React, so I learned how to make different components, how to export them into an app.js file, then export the app.js file to an index.js file. There was a lot of imports and exports going on, so it was a challenge to learn how to manage all of them.

I also learned how to host a server using Node and Express with React. It wasn't much different from a normal HTML and CSS page, but there were a coouple of tweaks that needed to be made in order to run the React build on Heroku.
